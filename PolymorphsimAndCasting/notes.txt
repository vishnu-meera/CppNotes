A pointer to derived class can be stored as a pointer to the base class.

Liskov substitutability

Virtual function ->derived class function
Non virtual function ->base class fucntion

Virtual table -->collection of memory, little bit cost of performance

one virtual function means->u need virtual destructor

Slicing.

derived object copy into base object--> derived object loose varibles


references are polymorphic in the same way as of pointers


casting
====================================================================

(type)  -->type cast
(static_cast)-->compile time and no run checks
(dynamic_cast)-->run time checks, works only with virtual destructor, slower but safe
(const_cast)-->not for a beginner

reinterpret_cast-->bit twiddling

=====================================================================


collections
------------------
vector-->for primary use
map-->for primary use
linked list
queue , dequeue,  priority_queue
set --uninon  difference
multimap
linked list is fater while adding and slower when accessing comapre to vector
================
